# LauncherPatcher
 A universal X-Legend launcher patcher that allows download from your own custom server.

# Note
This only patches the launcher to allow downloading patch files from your server and does not include tools to create said patch files. There is also a bug in the launcher where it doesn't escape url strings with a hastag ("#") in them, and will fail to download them. This is of course out of my control and is entirely on X-Legend's end.

## Limitations
Without the actual source code of their launcher it is impossible to exceed certain limits like the length of urls and log name.


I am in no way affiliated with X-Legend.
